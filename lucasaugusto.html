<h1>
    Why am I changing my professsional area? <br> </h1>
   <p> I can say that what most influenced me to do so, was the difference between me and the people my area usually got for me to work with. That said, it is known that work ends up becoming one of the most present scenarios in the life of each one, and the difference between me and my coworkers is whooping. I love to work with mechanics, but I love even more to be able to use my abilities, as to use my english,
    as to comunicate and learn in a more apropiate way than I've been exposed on those last years. </p>


<h2>
Why did I decided to make this project the way it is? <br> </h2>
<p>Well, I thought it would be a very interesting way to practice the knowing I got since I started studying thed computer area and present myself as professional and human for those who might be interested.</p>
