                    Published in 1866, Crime & Punishment is the most celebrated work of Dostoievski. In this book,
                    Raskolnikov, a poor and desperate young student, walks through the streets of Saint Petersburg until
                    committing a crime who he will try to justify by a teory: great mens, as Cesar and Napoleon, were
                    acquitted by History. This act results in a narrative full of labyrinths, fear and anxiety. You will
                    be transported to the inside of his disturbed mind, you will fear his fears, feel his fevers. His
                    feelings as revolt, hate, regret and pain. You will hate those who he hates, those people who pass
                    through his life, day by day, people who fight to preserve they dignity against lots of forms of
                    tyranny. <br>
                    Some other titles by Dostoievski I can recommend are "Notes from Underground" and "The Double". Both
                    of them will portrait the problems of human mind as anxiety, fear and retire from the world,
                    paranoids and insecurity<br>

                    Before I say something about the book per se, I've to talk about the author and his work as one. His
                    philosophy is, for sure, one of the best I could be in touch with. Even his novels are full of
                    philosophy, pain and questions about the human situation. I recommend not only this title, but all
                    of them. <br>
                    In "La Chute", a French lawyer makes his conscience exam in a sailor's pub, in Amsterdam. The
                    narrator, self-denominated "pertinet-judge", expose the human nature mixed to a pity self criticism
                    process. The man who speaks in "La Chute"gives himself a calculated confession. But where does the
                    confession start and where does the accusation start? He isolated himself from the world after
                    witness a suicide of a woman in the waters of the Sena.<br>

                    This is the first book I read from Bruno Latour, a great mind from philosophy, a great mind from the
                    mankind, who left us this month (10/2022).<br>
                    In this book-manifesto, Latour try to reconfigure the "modern" traditional division between nature
                    and culture, trying to understand the hybrid ones whom are increasingly in our society, as the
                    ecological disasters, the genetically modified organism and the robot with artificial
                    intelligence.<br>

                    In the words of the critic Roberto Taddei, "that proposes and
                    inaugurates a new path for literature that, from the dialogue with psychoanalysis and philosophy,
                    expands without being a tributary of them". If in his previous books the author-character isolated
                    himself in a kind of romanticism of negativity, here JP makes a leap: the idea of ​​the subject who
                    was born “outside”, estranged from the world – and, for that very reason, privileged to talk about
                    it –, loses its aura in the name of welcoming, of the possibility of entering and resonating with
                    the world. This turn is based on Sloterdijk's philosophy of the spheres, in contrast to the
                    negativity and emptiness characteristic of Heidegger's or Nietzsche's thought, which marked the
                    poet's prose- philosopher so far. Refusal of Non-Place is a moving (and far from self-indulgent)
                    account of abandonment, seclusion and successive failed attempts to enter the world, combined with
                    sophisticated philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts.<br>

                    Two men in a little boat. A monster in the depths below. This is the starting point
                    of The Book of the Sea. From the tiny island of Skrova in the Lofoten Islands, the sea is examined
                    throughout history, in storytelling, science, poetry and mythology. Hav er opphav, «the sea is
                    origin» and shelters the most fascinating life forms. For the author, the sea becomes a constant
                    source of rapture, new insights and adventures that leave the reader with a taste of salt. But The
                    Book of the Sea is also a reflection on the natural history of man, who managed to map the entire
                    world and navigate among the stars, but seems to maintain an obsession with the myth of the monster,
                    perhaps due to an atavistic predatory instinct or fear of the unknown that the sea still awakens us
                    today.<br>
                    The book counts with great references, as the mention of legendary guitar player Rober Fripp,
                    founder
                    of classic prog-rock band King Crimson and of various of important pieces of the music scenario

                    Written in Romanian when the author was 22 years old (later he would write in French), it is an
                    explosion of anguish and lyricism, which brutally and overwhelmingly expresses the pain of
                    existing.Winner of the Young Writers Award, the book is in part fruit of the readings of Nietzsche,
                    Schopenhauer, Bergson, Pascal and Dostoevsky. But, beyond these erudite influences, Nos cumes do
                    despair is the result, above all, of his experience with the harsh lucidity of insomnia, with the
                    harshness of uninterrupted vigil, that nothing without truce. From there, Cioran postulated the
                    uselessness of philosophy and discovered the relief of the disenchanted word, without which he would
                    have put an end to his nights. In the heights of despair he anticipates not only the themes? cosmic
                    nihilism, skepticism and lucid and radical meditation on the inconvenience of being born? but also
                    much of the style that would consecrate him.<br>

                    Robinson Crusoe's basic argument is universally known. Isolated on his “Island of Despair” (off the
                    coast of present-day Venezuela) after a tragic shipwreck, the English sailor fights for survival
                    using all the scarce means at his disposal. With time and the tools recovered from the ship, he
                    becomes a competent woodworker and farmer, as well as a goat herder and profound connoisseur of the
                    Bible - the only available reading. Without contact with any human being for more than two decades,
                    Crusoe one day saves a native from murder by cannibals who had landed on one of the beaches of the
                    island, and soon makes him his servant, giving him the name of Friday. A few years later, chance
                    brings an English ship near the island, starting a long conflict with the mutinous crew.<br>
